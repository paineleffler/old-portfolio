              <Paragraph>Wishlist was built out of a necessity of a place for do-ers to organize personal items or project work without creating additional overhead. My main goal was to allow people to use a process that worked for them, instead of trying to teach or show them ONE way to do project management. Wishlist was designed and developed by me from scratch in the beginning. Later, it was inter open-sourced and grew in features and contributors.</Paragraph>
