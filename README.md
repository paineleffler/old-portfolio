## About

Short and sweet portfolio site I made at the beginning of 2021. It uses Gatsby.js and Tailwindcss and showcases a couple of my old projects. It is currently deployed in Netlify and now located at [old.paineleffler.com](https://old.paineleffler.com) since my new one is now on [paineleffler.com](https://paineleffler.com).

## Future

This project is now shelved since my new site is now live. Another reason for changing this site is that Gatsby.js has gotten a little harder to maintain and I usually use this website to learn and try out new things, so it will be changing into [Remix](https://remix.run)!
